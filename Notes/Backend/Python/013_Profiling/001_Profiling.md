# Profiling

Source: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-debugging-handbook/#profiling

Profiling involves analyzing the performance of your code to identify bottlenecks and areas that can be optimized. Python provides built-in tools and external libraries for profiling, helping developers gain insights into their code's execution time and resource usage.

* Identify Performance Issues: Profiling allows you to pinpoint sections of your code that consume the most time and resources, aiding in optimization efforts.
* Optimize Code: Once bottlenecks are identified, developers can focus on optimizing specific functions or code blocks to enhance overall performance.
* Memory Usage Analysis: Profiling tools can also help in analyzing memory consumption, aiding in the detection of memory leaks and inefficient memory usage.

## cProfile

cProfile is a built-in module that provides a deterministic profiling of Python programs. It records the time each function takes to execute, making it easier to identify performance bottlenecks.

Example:
```python
import cProfile

def example_function():
    # Your code here

if __name__ == "__main__":
    cProfile.run('example_function()')
```
This will output a detailed report of function calls, their execution time, and the percentage of total time spent in each function.

## profile

profile:
The profile module is similar to cProfile but is implemented in pure Python. It provides a more detailed analysis of function calls and can be used when a more fine-grained profiling is needed.
```python
import profile

def example_function():
    # Your code here

if __name__ == "__main__":
    profile.run('example_function()')
```
Both cProfile and profile produce similar outputs, but the former is generally preferred for its lower overhead.

## snakeviz

While the built-in modules provide textual reports, visualizing the results can make it easier to understand and analyze. One popular tool for this is snakeviz.

```commandline
pip install snakeviz
```

```python
import cProfile
import snakeviz

def example_function():
    # Your code here

if __name__ == "__main__":
    cProfile.run('example_function()', 'profile_results')
    snakeviz.view('profile_results')
```
This will open a browser window displaying an interactive visualization of the profiling results.
